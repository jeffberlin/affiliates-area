                  <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;How are orders from my site tracked and credited?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;All links from your site to ours include a unique ID. This ID allows us to identify customers coming from your site and to credit you if they make a purchase.

                  <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;What if a customer does not buy right away? Will I still get credit for the sale?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Yes! The link provided will generate a cookie that stays 90 days. If the customer purchases within that amount of time, you will get credit for the sale, regardless of where the customer finalizes their purchase.

                  <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;What payment options do I have?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Unless otherwise requested, US&nbsp;affiliate's are paid via USD check.
                  <br>
                  Payments options are USD check (US & Canada only), ACH (US&nbsp;Affiliates only), PayPal or wire transfer.
                  <br>
                  By default accounts are set up as USD accounts. You can request your account to be specified as a EUR or GBP paid account.
                  <br>
                  Affiliates can choose wire transfer at the current wire transfer rate of 25.00 (USD, EUR or GBP) [Your account must have a $300 min. balance].
                  <br>
                  Payment minimums can be set for whatever amount you request. By default, wire transfers require a $300.00 balance, except on December 28th when all affiliates are paid regardless of amount owed for accounting purposes.
                  <br>
                  <u>Please note:</u>&nbsp;US Affiliates must receive three payments via paper check before switching to ACH/Direct Deposit. You will be responsible for keeping your banking information up to date. Once an ACH payment is made, it cannot be traced or canceled. To start receiving your payments via ACH, please fax a copy of a voided check from the account you wish to be paid to: (910)792-1889 or mail to:

                <p class="marginBottom"><strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;When and how do I get paid?</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                  <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;By default, US affiliates are made by check in US funds unless other arrangements have been made.&nbsp; Checks are made out to "Name" specified on the Account Info screen. If you prefer to have checks made out to your company, please contact us with your request.
                  <br>
                  Payments options for US &&nbsp;Canada residents are: USD check, ACH (after three paper checks have been successfully paid), PayPal and wire transfer.
                  <br>
                  Payment options for International affiliates are: PayPal and wire transfer. If you would like your payments via PayPal, please send us your PayPal email address. Your PayPal account must be enabled to receive funds.
                  <br>
                  Payments are made quarterly, April 1st, July 1st, October 1st, and December 28th.
                  <br>
                  There is a 60 day hold on the first payment. The 60 day hold is calculated from the date of your first sale, not from your signup date. If your first sale is within the last 5 days of the quarter, payment will be paid held until the next quarter after a full quarter of sales have been reviewed. Excessive fraud or chargeback activity may result in a longer hold on your funds at our discretion.
                  <br>
                  You may request monthly payments to be sent. This will result in a $5.00 administrative fee deducted from your payment amount. Payments are not issued for less than $20.00 ($300.00 for wire transfers).&nbsp; Payment dates for wire transfers may vary depending on banking hours. If you have any questions regarding your payments please contact <a href="mailto:jenni@bmtmicro.com">jenni@bmtmicro.com</a>.
